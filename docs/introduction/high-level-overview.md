# High Level Overview

### Soarchain is multi-purpose Layer 1 network that enables a token-incentivized data and connectivity infrastructure for mobility.

â€‹[Soarchain](https://www.soarchain.com/) is a global, distributed network that create a public data infrasturcture and connectivity layer for mobility members. Car miners - Soarchain devices - produce and are compensated in $SOAR, the native cryptocurrency of the Soarchain blockchain. The Soarchain blockchain is a new, open source, public blockchain created entirely to incentivize the creation of physical, decentralized mobility network.

### The blockchain solution for the connected vehicle space
Cars become more sensor-oriented, the data they generate is increasing rapidly. This data is valuable for both in-vehicle systems and external applications. So we need a decentralized and trusted protocol for vehicles to directly share data. This will unlock a huge economy and novel revenue streams.

### Earn while owning your vehicle data

Users can gather, utilize, and profit from the data from their vehicles using Soarchain decentralized applications.

### Developers & Data Consumers

Developers and data consumers use the car generated data from the car owners to create apps and services on a reliable, open platform, which lowers the price of providing users with better goods and services.

### Features
#### Soarchain is
- **Appchain**, a single purpose blockchain designed for mobility.
- **Interchain for Mobility**, interoperable with other chains due to the Cosmos SDK.
- **Gateway of Web3 for Mobility** that brings existing Web3 applications to vehicles and mobility space.
- **Infrastructure Independent** with direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication.
