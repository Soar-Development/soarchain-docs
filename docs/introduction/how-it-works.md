# How it Works?

## Workflow
#### Decentralized connectivity layer for real-time transactions between vehicles
- Soarchain offers a trustless, permissionless, decentralized and distributed way to enable connectivity between vehicles.
- Participant vehicles of the network are incentivized to cryptographically prove their availability to the other participants through the network using secure hardwares called ​[Soarchain devices](https://www.soarchain.com/devices).
- The broadcast messages are received and verified by other network participants. Each participant in the network is expected to both broadcast and receive messages.
- Broadcasting honest and correct messages & receiving and verifying these messages are rewarded through the network’s incentive mechanism with native [$SOAR](/category/soar-token) Tokens.
- ​[Decentralized Applications](https://www.soarchain.com/application-ecosystem) are enabled through Soarchain’s native smart contracts and this creates a decentralized data ecosystem for mobility.
