# How It Works

## Workflow
#### Decentralized connectivity layer for real-time transactions between vehicles
- Soarchain provides a trustless, permissionless, decentralized network that enables vehicles to communicate directly without relying on centralized systems.
- Vehicles equipped with **[Soarchain devices](https://www.soarchain.com/devices)** generate real-time data and prove their availability cryptographically.
- Broadcast messages are verified by other network participants to ensure accuracy and security.
- Vehicles that contribute accurate data are rewarded with [$SOAR](/category/soar-token) tokens.
- [Decentralized Applications](https://www.soarchain.com/application-ecosystem) built on Soarchainâ€™s smart contracts create a data ecosystem for mobility solutions.
