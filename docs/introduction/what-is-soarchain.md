# What is Soarchain?

<p align="center">
A decentralized network for real-time mobility data sharing.
</p>

>
**​[Soarchain](https://www.soarchain.com/) is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) built on [Solana](https://solana.com/), enabling real-time data sharing between vehicles and the mobility ecosystem. With Soarchain’s native smart contracts, vehicle-generated data is verified and used to create decentralized applications that transform the future of transportation.**

### New Possibilities for Mobility
Soarchain revolutionizes transportation by enabling users to own and monetize their vehicle-generated data while accessing innovative services such as dynamic insurance and predictive maintenance.

### How Soarchain Works
Soarchain devices connect vehicles to the network, allowing them to contribute verified data in real-time. This data is used to power decentralized mobility applications and services.

### Purpose-Specific Solution
Soarchain leverages Solana’s blockchain to enable secure, real-time data processing for decentralized mobility solutions.

### Decentralized Application Ecosystem
[Soarchain’s decentralized ecosystem](https://www.soarchain.com/application-ecosystem) enables innovative applications built on secure, verified vehicle data.
