### --❓-- Is Soarchain a layer 1 protocol or does it run on another chain?

**Soarchain is not a Layer 1 protocol. It operates on the Solana blockchain, leveraging Solana's infrastructure to provide a scalable, decentralized platform for mobility solutions.** 

While Soarchain originally functioned as a Layer 1, the migration to Solana allows it to focus on enabling secure, real-time data sharing between vehicles without the need to manage its own blockchain. By utilizing Solana’s ecosystem, Soarchain scales efficiently and supports advanced mobility and AI-based applications.
