>**--‚ùì-- Is Soarchain a layer 1 protocol or does it run on another chain?**

Yes, Soarchain is an application-specific Layer 1  blockchain that is optimized to serve fully-decentralized mobility applications, ranging from forward collision warning to pre-crash warning, predictive maintenance, remote diagnostics, pay-as-you-drive insurance, fleet management, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, and ultimately to autonomous fleet driving. 

Instead of building a decentralized application on top of an underlying blockchain like Ethereum, we have built our own blockchain with the help of Tendermint Core BFT consensus layer and networking layer, and Cosmos SDK for the control of the state-machine logic and built-in functionalities that it provides such as smart contracts and staking. Our blockchain employs novel implementations of data availability scaling solutions that include random network subsampling and challenge mechanisms through the use of well-established cryptographic primitives and stochastic models.
