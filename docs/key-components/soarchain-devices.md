# Soarchain Devices

**Soarchain Mini** is the plug-and-play device that connects vehicles to the Soarchain network, allowing them to share valuable real-time data, including engine diagnostics, fuel consumption, battery levels, and various sensor readings. Soarchain Mini enables vehicles to broadcast this data, which is then processed and verified within the network.

With Soarchain Mini, vehicles become active participants in the decentralized mobility ecosystem, contributing data to applications such as predictive maintenance, AI-driven diagnostics, and smart insurance models.

Vehicle owners who use Soarchain Mini can **own and monetize** their data, earning $SOAR tokens for their contributions. These tokens can be used within the Soarchain ecosystem or exchanged, providing a new revenue stream for vehicle owners. The device also allows vehicles to access real-time diagnostics and other mobility applications, improving performance and safety.
