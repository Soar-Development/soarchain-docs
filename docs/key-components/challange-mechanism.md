# Challange Mechanism


As an efficient data availability verification method, Soarchain utilizes various challenge mechanisms. A challenge is simply a request to receive data to be verified from a node which claims to have generated that specific data. It provides the participating nodes a cryptographically secure way to prove that their connectivity and computational resources have been available throughout a specific timeframe. 

Due to the high degrees of mobility and heterogeneous distribution of the vehicle types of the participating network nodes, multiple types of challenges exist within the network to ensure the correct and honest operation of nodes which results in fair and timely distribution of rewards. 

Challenge mechanisms in Soarchain are designed to maximize the useful work done by each node to serve the main applications/functions of the network while also verifying the and securing the nodes with minimal non-useful work. The presented data in response to a challenge is utilized for doing useful work such as verifying that the node which provided the response in fact is acting honestly.
