# Runner Infrastructure

The **Runner infrastructure** forms the backbone of Soarchainâ€™s network, providing both verification and computational power. Runners process the vehicle-generated data shared within the network, ensuring that it is accurate and secure before being used in real-time mobility applications.

Runners handle data such as engine diagnostics, fuel consumption, battery status, and other in-vehicle metrics. They verify the authenticity of this data, ensuring that only accurate and trustworthy information is used by developers and decentralized applications.

In addition to verification, Runners provide the **computational power** needed for more complex applications, such as AI-driven diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and dynamic insurance models. This computational capacity enables Soarchain to support large-scale, data-intensive tasks, ensuring that the network can handle the demands of modern mobility solutions.

The Runner infrastructure allows Soarchain to scale, processing data from millions of vehicles in real-time while maintaining high levels of accuracy and efficiency.
