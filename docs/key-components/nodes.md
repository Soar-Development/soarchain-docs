# Nodes (Guardians)

**Guardian nodes** are the key validators in Soarchain’s decentralized network, responsible for ensuring the accuracy and security of vehicle-generated data. Guardians verify data contributions from vehicles, such as engine diagnostics, fuel consumption, and in-car system performance, to ensure that the data meets the required network standards.

By participating in the **consensus process**, Guardians validate data before it is used in Soarchain’s decentralized applications, ensuring that all data within the network is trustworthy. This protects the integrity of the network and prevents the use of inaccurate or fraudulent data.

Guardians also manage the **reward distribution process**, ensuring that vehicles contributing valuable data are compensated in $SOAR tokens based on their verified contributions. This incentivizes active participation and encourages vehicles to share accurate and valuable data.
