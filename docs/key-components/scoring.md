# Scoring


### Scoring Mechanism

When messaging nodes join the Soarchain network, they are assigned a score φn. Any messaging node that scores higher than the initially assigned score is considered to be a well-functioning node. 

The reward distribution process is executed according to the score of a messaging node, which is an indicator of how well it has been performing in its correct and honest state.
