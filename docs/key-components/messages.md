# Messages & Data Flow

In Soarchain, **messages** represent the flow of vehicle-generated data within the network. These messages carry critical information from vehicles, such as engine performance, fuel levels, and sensor data, ensuring that all data is shared in real-time.

Messages are transmitted between vehicles and the network, allowing for the continuous flow of data that powers decentralized applications. The **Runner infrastructure** verifies these messages, ensuring that the data is accurate and secure before it is processed.

This real-time data flow is essential for applications like predictive maintenance, AI-driven diagnostics, and dynamic insurance models. By maintaining efficient data flow, Soarchain can support millions of connected vehicles and enable continuous improvements in mobility.
