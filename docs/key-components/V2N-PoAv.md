# Proof-of-Availability (PoA)

Soarchainâ€™s **Proof-of-Availability (PoA)** ensures that vehicles contributing data are actively present and generating real-time information. PoA operates in two key contexts:

- **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) PoA**: Vehicles prove their availability by broadcasting real-time data, such as engine diagnostics and fuel levels, to nearby vehicles. This data is verified by other participants to ensure accuracy and active contribution.
  
- **Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) PoA**: Vehicles share data directly with the network, confirming their presence and activity. The network verifies this data to ensure that the vehicle is actively participating and eligible for rewards.

PoA ensures that only active vehicles contributing verified data receive rewards, guaranteeing the quality and reliability of the data shared within the network.
