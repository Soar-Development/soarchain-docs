# Motus (Onboard Units)


### [MOTUS](https://www.soarchain.com/motus)  are the open-source hardware units that enable the vehicles to communicate with each other, the infrastructure, people and the cloud through different communication protocols.


- **Cellular-V2X PC5 Mode 4** protocol for disseminating signed and encrypted messages that help vehicles and other proximate nodes become aware of each other and directly exchange information.


- **Cellular communication (5G-NR/4G-LTE)** for constant connectivity to the main network. This enables message-generating vehicles and message-processing vehicles to send verified proofs to be validated by the validator network and in order to successfully get included in the next block.


- **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth** for user/driver connectivity, visualization of applications and data on the smartphone.

- **Storage and processing power** for executing proof-related processes and storing logs from different sources within the internal network of the vehicle.

- **Trusted Platform Module and Hardware Security Module** for securely storing master and private keys, accelerating cryptographic functions and preventing tampering of the hardware.

- **CAN and OBD-II** access to the vehicle for reading real-time device and diagnostics information.

- **High-precision GNSS and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** to provide data for localization, safety and autonomy applications.


> There are different types of Motus devices which support different configurations and proof mechanisms. Motus is the full-fledged hardware that employs all the aforementioned features and is able to participate in all the proof mechanisms in Soarchain, as well as issue all types of challenges. 
>
> **[MOTUS Mini](https://www.soarchain.com/motus-mini)** is the low-end hardware which employs only a few of these features and links directly to the userâ€™s mobile device to use it as a relay device. They can only participate in network-based proof mechanisms. Motus can be thought of as a light, messaging and computational node.
