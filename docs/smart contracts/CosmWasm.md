## What is CosmWasm?

A smart contracting platform called CosmWasm was created for the Cosmos ecosystem. Simply described, it uses WebAssembly (Wasm) in the Cosmos (Cosm) fashion, thus the name.

The Cosmos SDK can accept modules that have been created for CosmWasm. Thus, anybody presently developing a blockchain using the Cosmos SDK may quickly and simply add CosmWasm smart contracting capabilities to their chain without changing the existing logic.
