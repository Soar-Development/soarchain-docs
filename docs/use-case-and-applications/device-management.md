# Device Management

As Soarchain creates a secure, decentralized, private and trustless way of connecting a vehicle to other endpoints, management of all the connected devices must be done in a secure and robust way. Soarchain can potentially become a platform to deploy decentralized and upgraded versions of today’s remote configuration, monitoring, and over-the-air (OTA) software updates solutions on the market. 

### Remote Configuration

Remote configuration can be a time consuming and error-prone process. However, with Soarchain’s vehicle-to-network technology and smart-contracts supporting blockchain, this process can be automated, secure, and reliable. By leveraging the distributed ledger, smart contracts can be used to automatically configure settings, devices, and networks. Furthermore, since each transaction is stored on the distributed ledger, it can be verified and audited to ensure that the configuration is secure and compliant with the appropriate regulations. 


### Remote Monitoring 

Soarchain can also be used to monitor remote systems in a secure and reliable manner. By leveraging the distributed ledger and decentralized identifiers(DID), organizations can track and monitor remote systems in real-time, ensuring that all data is secure, accurate, authentic and integral. Furthermore, the distributed ledger can also be used to store data related to the systems, such as system configurations, user access, and other relevant information. 

### Secure Native OTA

Similar to Remote Configuration, Soarchain can also enable over-the-air (OTA) software updates through its vehicle-to-network technology and smart-contracts supporting blockchain, and even facilitate vehicle-to-vehicle OTA without needing to backhaul to an internet-connected server. By leveraging the distributed ledger, organizations can ensure that all updates are cryptographically signed and verified before being deployed. Furthermore, it can also be used to store metadata related to the updates, such as version numbers, security patches, and other relevant information.
