# Road Safety

#### Some of the road safety applications that Soarchain enables include collision avoidance, emergency vehicle notification, and vulnerable road user safety.

### Collision Avoidance

Soarchain technology can be used to help vehicles detect potential collisions and take appropriate action to avoid them. For example, a vehicle equipped with Soarchain technology is able to receive a warning from another vehicle about a stationary vehicle on the road ahead, and the driver could take evasive action to brake immediately.

### Emergency Vehicle Notification 

Soarchain technology enables emergency vehicles, such as ambulances and fire trucks, to alert other vehicles on the road when they are approaching. This can help other vehicles to quickly move out of the way, allowing the emergency vehicle to reach its destination more quickly. 

Emergency vehicle notification is typically implemented using V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication, which allows vehicles to exchange information with each other in real time. When an emergency vehicle is approaching, it can use V2V communication to send a warning to other vehicles in the area. This warning can be displayed on the other vehicles' dashboard or navigation system, alerting the driver to the presence of the emergency vehicle and prompting them to move out of the way.

### Vulnerable Road User Safety

Soarchain technology can be used to improve safety for pedestrians by alerting drivers when a pedestrian is nearby. For example, a vehicle could receive a warning from a pedestrian's smartphone about their presence and take appropriate action to avoid them. Vulnerable road users are particularly at risk in traffic because they are often less visible to other road users and are less protected in the event of a collision. For example, pedestrians and bicyclists are not enclosed in a vehicle and do not have the same level of protection as car occupants, making them more vulnerable to injury in the event of a collision and Soarchain technology can help to reduce this risk by providing drivers with additional information about the presence and movements of vulnerable road users.

Vulnerable road user safety is implemented using Soarchainâ€™s V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) communication. For example, a vehicle equipped with V2V technology could receive a warning from another vehicle or a pedestrian's smartphone about a vulnerable road user in the area. The vehicle could then use this information to adjust its speed and route to avoid the vulnerable road user, improving their safety.
