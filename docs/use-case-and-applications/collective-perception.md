# Collective Perception

Collective perception applications refer to the use of Soarchain’s technology to enable vehicles to share and combine sensory data to improve their understanding of their surroundings. Some examples of collective perception applications include platooning, collective sensor fusion, and flow optimization.

### Platooning

Soarchain enables platooning, which involves groups of vehicles traveling and closely together in a coordinated manner, with each vehicle receiving information from the other vehicles in the platoon to improve their understanding of the surrounding environment. This can help to improve the efficiency and safety of the platoon by enabling the vehicles to react to changes in their surroundings more quickly and effectively.

Soarchain’s direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is a key technology that enables platooning. By using V2V communication, vehicles in the platoon can exchange information about their speed, position, and intended actions with each other in real time. This allows the platoon to maintain a closely spaced formation and to coordinate their movements, allowing them to react to changes in their surroundings more quickly and effectively.

For example, if one vehicle in the platoon needs to brake suddenly to avoid an obstacle, it can use V2V communication to send a warning to the other vehicles in the platoon. This allows the other vehicles to brake more quickly, reducing the risk of a collision and improving the safety of the platoon. 

Soarchain’s V2V communication is essential for enabling platooning, as it allows vehicles in the platoon to exchange information and coordinate their movements in real time, improving the efficiency and safety of the platoon.

### Collective Sensor Fusion

Soarchain enables collective sensor fusion which involves vehicles sharing sensory data with each other, such as information from their cameras, radar, and lidar sensors. This data can be combined and used to improve the accuracy and reliability of the vehicle's understanding of its surroundings, allowing it to make more informed decisions about how to navigate the environment.
Soarchain’s direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is a key technology that enables collective sensor fusion. By using V2V communication, vehicles can share their sensory data with each other in real time. This allows the vehicles to combine their sensory data and create a more complete picture of their surroundings, improving their understanding of the environment and allowing them to make more informed decisions about how to navigate it.

For example, if one vehicle has mapped the road ahead, it can use V2V communication to share this information with the other vehicles in the group. This allows the other vehicles to take appropriate action to avoid the obstacle, improving the safety of the group.


### Flow Optimization

Soarchain enables flow optimization which involves using vehicle-to-vehicle(V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure(V2I) and vehicle-to-network(V2N)technology to coordinate the movement of vehicles in a way that optimizes the flow of traffic. For example, vehicles communicate with each other and with traffic signals to coordinate their speed and lane changes, reducing congestion and improving overall traffic flow. This 

Soarchain’s both direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and vehicle-to-network (V2N) communication are essential for enabling flow optimization. V2V communication allows vehicles to exchange information with each other in real time, allowing them to coordinate their movements and avoid congestion and drive cooperatively. V2N communication, on the other hand, allows vehicles to communicate with traffic signals and other infrastructure, allowing them to adjust their speed and route to optimize the flow of traffic.

For example, if a group of vehicles is approaching a traffic light that is about to turn red, they can use V2V communication to coordinate their speed and position to avoid having to stop at the light. This helps to reduce congestion and improve the flow of traffic, thus reducing overall energy consumed and carbon emissions.
