# Validators

A validator is a special type of node that is responsible for participating in the consensus process to reach agreement on the state of the blockchain. Validators can be thought of as the “miners” of the blocks, as they are responsible for ensuring the integrity and security of the network. Validators are chosen by the community through a staking process, and they are rewarded for their participation in the consensus process. 

Soarchain is a public Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, which means that the weight of validators is based on the quantity of staking tokens ($MOTUS) bonded as collateral. These MOTUS tokens may be self-delegated by the validator or delegated by other MOTUS holders to the validator.

By sending a create-validator transaction, every user in the system can declare their intention to become validator candidates. A validator's weight (voting power) decides whether they are an active validator. The active validator set is restricted to an amount which may slightly change over time.
