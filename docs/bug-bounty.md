## Introduction

The Soarchain Bug Bounty Program is designed to encourage members of the community, including validators, to contribute towards identifying and resolving bugs or vulnerabilities within the Soarchain network. This program aims to foster a robust, secure, and efficient ecosystem by incentivizing the discovery and reporting of issues in various components of the network.


## Scope

The program covers all components of the Soarchain network, including but not limited to:

- Blockchain Core
- Smart Contracts
- Soarchain Connect App
- Node Software
- APIs and Integrations
- Soarchain devices
- Websites and Documentations

## Rewards

Rewards will be distributed in SOAR tokens and are based on two key factors: the severity of the issue (impact on the network and users) and the gravity of the issue (type and complexity). The rewards are categorized as follows:

**Critical Issues (High Severity & High Gravity):**
- Impact: Widespread impact, affecting a significant portion of the network or critical system components.
- Reward: Up to 10,000 SOAR tokens.

**Major Issues (High Severity & Medium Gravity):**
- Impact: Affects several users or crucial network functionalities, but not at a widespread level.
- Reward: Up to 5,000 SOAR tokens.

**Moderate Issues (Medium Severity & Variable Gravity):**
- Impact: Affects limited users or has potential for more significant impact if not addressed.
- Reward: Up to 2,000 SOAR tokens.

**Minor Issues (Low Severity & Any Gravity):**
- Impact: Minor impact with no immediate threat to the network or users.
- Reward: Up to 500 SOAR tokens.

**Suggestions and Enhancements:**
- Impact: Proposals for improvements, optimizations, or feature requests.
- Reward: Up to 250 SOAR tokens, based on the potential impact and feasibility.

## Submission Process
