# Block Explorer

## Introduction

Blockchain explorers allow users to query the blockchain for data. Explorers are often compared to search engines for the blockchain. By using an explorer, users can search and track balances, transactions, contracts, and other broadcasted data to the blockchain.

Soarchain now offers a block explorer for the **Soarchain Devnet**.
