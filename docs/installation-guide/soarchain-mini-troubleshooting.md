Some quick reasons why the ***Soarchain Provisioning*** app prompts ```Device not Found``` after you scan the QR code can be: 

 - Qr code scanned was incorrect or unreadable because of its distance to the camera, orientation or lighting. 
 - Soarchain mini was not plugged into your car or the LED was not on when you scanned the Qr code. 
 - You did not enable the settings written on the docs. (Bluetooth - Cellular Data - Mobile Hotspot) 
 - Your mobile phoneâ€™s Bluetooth is connected to another device then the Soarchain mini when you scan the QR code. 
 - You have already provisioned your device successfully.

Please go to the:
**Settings > Connections > Mobile Hotspot & Tethering > Mobile Hotspot**
(Mobile Hotspot location can differ from phone to phone)
and check whether there is a device called ```Motusmini``` connected to your phone?

 - You entered your phone's hotspot password wrong and you need a provisioning reset. Click [here](#provisioning-reset) to do a provisioning reset.
