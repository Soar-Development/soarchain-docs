# Motus-mini Setup

Download the Motus Connect App if you haven’t already downloaded it. 

To download the app, scan the QR code from your phone’s camera. It is advised to follow the detailed steps in the QR code/URL while setting up the Motus mini for the first time.


Create your wallet from the Motus Connect App if you haven’t already created it.


Make sure your mobile phone is connected to your SIM card’s cellular network. From your phone’s settings turn on the Bluetooth and enable the Personal Hotspot setting.


Plug your Motus mini to your vehicle’s generic OBD2 port. The OBD2 port is generally found under the steering wheel on the left side of the driver seat. 


After plugging the Motus mini to the vehicle's OBD2 port, the Motus mini will flash a red light meaning it is connected correctly and ready for the setup.
