### Registration - Provision your Soarchain mini

Provisioning is a crucial step that links your Soarchain Mini device to your phone's hotspot network. The Soarchain Mini requires an internet connection to operate, which is supplied via your phone's hotspot network. 

Before continuing with the next step, please make sure that your **Cellular Data** and **Personal Hotspot** settings are on. 

1️⃣. Open the **Soarchain Provisioning** app after downloading it.

2️⃣. Read the instructions carefully in the app before starting the provisioning process.

<details>
  <summary>I have already provisioned the device before</summary>
  <div>

> If you have provisioned the device before, you need to make sure that the hotspot is connected to your vehicle.

To confirm a successful hotspot connection with your Soarchain device, ensure it is linked to your phone's hotspot. 

While the Soarchain mini is plugged to your vehicle enable the hotspot settings.

A connected device of **Motusmini** on the ```Settings > Connections > Mobile Hotspot & Tethering > Mobile Hotspot``` signifies a successful connection. 

<p align="center">

 ![android_connected](/img/android_connected_mini.jpg)

</p>

> If you don't see any connection you need to do a provisioning reset and start the provisioning steps from the beginning and enter the correct password. 

> To do a provisioning reset, while the device is connected to your car, press and hold the button on the device for 6 seconds.

> Disconnect and then reconnect the Soarchain Mini to your car. Close the **Soarchain Provisioning** app, reopen it, and start again from the QR code scanning step.


  </div>
</details>

3️⃣. Retrieve your Soarchain mini box and locate the QR code sticker inside the top lid.

</details>


<details>
  <summary>I can't scan the QR code.</summary>
  <div>

Ensure the QR code is clearly visible and properly aligned with your camera.

If you encounter any errors, verify that your Bluetooth is active and that no other devices are connected to your Bluetooth or Personal Hotspot.

Another potential cause of scanning errors could be that the Soarchain mini is already provisioned to your phone. Please check if the device has been previously provisioned.

  </div>
</details>


5️⃣. Scanning the QR code will take you to a ```Select Wi-Fi Network``` screen listing nearby Wi-Fi networks.

6️⃣. Select your **phone’s personal hotspot name** from the available network names listed on the app.

- The phone’s hotspot name is the same as the phone’s name visible under ```Settings > Connections > Mobile Hotspot & Tethering > Mobile Hotspot```. 
> The location of the Mobile Hotspot settings can vary based on different phone models.

- If you don’t see your phone’s name on the screen, press the refresh icon on the top right.

  </div>
</details>

🔟. Once done, close the **Soarchain Provisioning** app and return to the **Soarchain Connect** app. This completes the provisioning process.


### Registration - Final checks

After successfully completing the provisioning process close the ***Soarchain Secure Provisioning*** app and come back to the ***Soarchain Connect*** app, press the ```Already Provisioned``` button.

On the ```Registration Checks``` screen, wait for the final checks to be done of your device.  Then, wait for the ```Register Device``` button to turn blue and then press it to complete the registration.

<details>
  <summary>Issue on "Verifying balance"</summary>
  <div>

The average gas fee required for the registration transaction is approximately 0.01 tSOAR. To successfully complete this check, your balance must exceed 0.01 tSOAR.

If your balance is less than 0.01 tSOAR, or if you encounter an error during this check, please create a [support ticket](#discord) on the Soarchain Discord server for assistance.

  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Issue on "Checking Soarchain Device Connection"</summary>
  <div>

This check is necessary to confirm the connection between your phone and the Soarchain Mini. If you encounter an error, please ensure that you have provisioned your Soarchain Mini and that the device is connected to your phone's hotspot network.

Alternatively, you can unplug and replug the Soarchain Mini into your car, restart the Soarchain Connect app, verify the hotspot connection, and then try again.

  </div>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Issue on "Validating Soarchain Device Pubkey"</summary>
  <div>

This process verifies that your Soarchain Mini has a valid public key and is not linked to a different wallet.

- Should the public key be absent or not retrievable from the Soarchain Mini, it means your device cannot validate the Soarchain Device. In this case, the public key is either unavailable or not defined. To resolve this, please wait for the current check to complete, or restart the process. You can do this by unplugging and replugging the Soarchain Mini into your vehicle, restarting the Soarchain Connect app, ensuring the hotspot connection is active, and then attempting the procedure once more.

- In the event the public key is already associated with a different wallet, it indicates that your Soarchain device is pre-registered with another wallet. To utilize this device, you need to first import the wallet that's currently registered. After importing, you can either continue using the Soarchain device with the existing wallet or unregister it to link it with a new wallet.

If the issue still persists, please create a [support ticket](#discord) on the Soarchain Discord server for assistance.

  </div>
</details>


### Earning Rewards

Upon successful registration of your device, you will unlock the complete set of features offered by the Soarchain Connect app, and you'll begin to accumulate tSOAR tokens. It's crucial to note the following:

To earn rewards, you must:

- The Soarchain mini should be plugged to your vehicle while driving.
- Make sure the your phone's personal hotspot is enabled and the connection between Soarchain mini and your phone is linked while using the app.

### Important Notes

#### Never loose your 24-word keyphrase!!!

> ❗ It is essential that you **record these 24 seed words in a secure location** and ensure they are not lost. **Under no circumstances should you share these 24 seed words with anyone, including the Soarchain team!**

> ❗ If you **lose these 24 words**, you will be **unable to access your wallet account or your Soarchain Mini forever!**

> ❗**Soarchain team has no access to your wallet and will not recover these words!**


#### Soarchain mini firmware over-the-air update (OTA) 

When an update is available for the Soarchain Mini device firmware, the device will automatically initiate the download of the latest firmware version as soon as it connects to the hotspot.

If the Soarchain Connect mobile app is open during the firmware installation, you will be able to track the update progress.

> ℹ️ **Do Not Unplug the Device:**
Please keep your Soarchain Mini connected to your vehicle.

> ℹ️ **Keep the App Open:**
Ensure that the Soarchain Connect app remains open during the entire update process.

> ℹ️ **Maintain Internet Connection:**
Do not disable your internet connection during the update.

Please be aware that following the Over-The-Air (OTA) update, the device will automatically reset itself, which may result in a temporary disconnection from the hotspot. It is important to ensure that the hotspot is reconnected before proceeding with any further actions involving the app or the Soarchain Mini device.


#### Changing your hotspot settings

After the setup process for the Soarchain mini is finished, it will maintain its connection to your mobile phone using the credentials you provided. However, **if you modify the name or password of your phone's hotspot credentials, the Soarchain mini will no longer be able to connect to your phone**. 

Therefore, you should avoid changing your hotspot name or password, or alternatively, perform a device reset and repeat the provisioning process from start after you change your credentials. 

To do a provisioning reset, while the device is connected to your car, press and hold the button on the device for 6 seconds. Repeat the Provisioning steps from the **Soarchain Provisioning** app.

> If your Soarchain mini doesn't have a button on it please go to the  ​[provisioning reset](installation-guide/soarchain-mini-troubleshooting.md#provisioning-reset) page.
